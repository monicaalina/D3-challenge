# D3-challenge

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

It is required that to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age. Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements and include the following elements:

* State abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

After that, try to include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in the scatter plot and give them click events so that the users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.

While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
